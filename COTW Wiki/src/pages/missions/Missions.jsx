          Missions are provided by the reserve wardens. The local residents have various needs that can be accomplished
          through hunting. Cash and XP can be gained by completing missions. Any number of missions and challenges can

          the Huntermate.

            <p>
              Missions on the Hirschfelden Hunting Reserve are provided by the reserve warden Cornelia Holzer. The reserve has 28 main missions: 3 tasks at the very beginning are given by Cornelia herself, she transfers the rest from other people (writer Gerlinde Jager, shooting fan Robert Sommer, biologist Vinay Bhandari, dreamer ranger Albertina Fleischer, businessperson Marwin Tressler), each gives 5 main missions. Also this map has a fantastic amount of 70 side missions.

              Story campaign is completely absent. While DLC reserves have stories of varying quality with 2-3 storylines (ecology, family, mistakes of the past, investigation, poachers, crimes), the Hirschfelden missions are simply sets of tasks from a group of people related to shooting certain game in a certain way and taking pictures.

              Missions on the Layton Lake District are provided by the reserve warden Colton Locke. The reserve has 28 main missions: 3 tasks at the very beginning are given by Colton himself, he transfers the rest from other people, each gives 5 main missions. Also this map has fantastic amount of 70 side missions.

While DLC reserves have stories of varying quality with 2-3 storylines (ecology, family, mistakes of the past, investigation, poachers, crimes), the Layton Lake missions are simply sets of tasks from a group of people related to shooting certain game in a certain way and taking pictures.

            <p>
              Missions on the Revontuli Coast are provided by the reserve warden Oiva Reijo Ikävalko. The reserve has 8 main missions, and 4 side missions.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-2">
              A notable feature of the local campaign is the complete absence of story missions about hunting itself (harvesting and photographing of animals is moved to additional missions with "collect the full list" goals). The campaign focuses on sightseeing and listening to the warden's stories.
